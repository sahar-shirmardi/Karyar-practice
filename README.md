# Karyar-practice
Karyar college web development course exercises.

The basic course codes were added in the 'Basic' branch.
Session 1 is actually the second session in the whole course, 
but since the first session was only an introductory session, no codes were provided.

The advanced course codes were added in the 'Advanced' branch.

Feel free to make any changes (in a separate branch).
Good luck!
